# Information on the Dataset

* **Date_of_Datarecorded**: This column captures the exact date when the data was recorded.

* **Residence_Jurisdiction**: Represents the region or locality for which the data is collected. It helps in analyzing trends and metrics specific to different geographical areas.

* **Period**: This column indicates the time period (e.g., weekly, total) for which the data is aggregated. It allows for analysis based on different periods of data collection.

* **Data_Period_start**: Denotes the start date of the specific data period. It helps in determining the exact duration of the reported figures.

* **Data_Period_end**: This is the end date of the specific data period. Together with the start date, it defines the window during which the data was collected.

* **Covid_Deaths**: The number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 in the specified jurisdiction during the data period. This is a key metric for analyzing the severity of the pandemic in different regions.

* **Total_Covid_Prct**: The percentage of total deaths that were caused by COVID-19. This percentage highlights the proportion of deaths directly related to the pandemic within each jurisdiction.

* **Pct_Change_Weekly**: The week-over-week percentage change in COVID-related metrics, such as deaths or infection rates. It is crucial for identifying spikes or declines in the spread of COVID-19 over time.

* **Pct_Diff_Weekly**: Represents the difference between percentage changes over consecutive weeks. This allows for analyzing the volatility or consistency of COVID-related trends.

* **Crude_Covid_Rate**: This column provides the crude rate of COVID-19 deaths per a certain population size (e.g., per 100,000 people). It is used to compare the relative impact of COVID-19 across regions, accounting for population differences.

* **aa_Covid_Rate**: The age-adjusted COVID-19 death rate, which factors in the age distribution of the population. This is important for making more accurate comparisons across regions with varying age demographics.
